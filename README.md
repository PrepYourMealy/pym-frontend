# Food-Creator

Food-Creator is a small utility vercel project written in T3. It is a service that scrapes the discounts from aldi and lidl and then asks chatgpt to
combine them into one menu for the week. This helps me not thinking about what I need to cook and budgets my expenses.

# Architecture

There is one cron github action that scrapes the weekly discounts from aldi and lidl and stores them into the products collection. Then these products are used to create a openai api call that generates the dishes from the discounted products. On the website you can access your shoppinglist and the dishes for every day for the next week.
